He currently lives in Chicago, IL, USA, which sits on the traditional homelands of the people of the Council of Three Fires, the Ojibwe, Potawatomi, and Odawa as well as the Menominee, Miami and Ho-Chunk nations.","Jade is an Associate Professor in the Department of Fiber and Material Studies at the School of the Art Institute of Chicago.","Jade Yumang examines how queer optics permeate into a culture, and how that is absorbed, embodied, repeated, and eventually materialized into deviating forms through various techniques to convey notions of phenomenology, affect, and “queer” as a process. This strategy is usually executed through three-dimensional, site-specific installation, and performative work as a way to see how the body resists or submits through materiality and technique vis-à-vis obsessive acts, strict parameters, and discipline. They look at flickers of resistance by outlining historical amnesia, myths, scandal trials, obscenity laws, love, kinship, joy, film tropes, and pornography. He kindles these moments through meticulous techniques and creates abstract shapes that initially originate from a corporeal source. Typically, these ideas are tackled through a large series to tease out their formal qualities with the context that repetition creates differences and asserts a constant change. They primarily use fiber techniques because of their reliability on tension and force to create materials that are strong and resilient while being soft and pliable.","jade@jadeyumang.com\r\n<a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/jadeyumang/\">@jadeyumang</a>\r\n"],"columnOne":["# Selected Solos\r\n\r\n## 2022\r\n*Open House Spatter*, Western Exhibitions, Chicago, IL.\r\n\r\n*Open House Spatter*, CIRCA Art Actuel, Montréal, QC.\r\n\r\n## 2021\r\n*Open House Spatter*, Art-in-Buildings, 125 Maiden Lane, Time Equities Inc., New York, NY.\r\n<small>curated by Tessa Ferreyros and Eliana Blechman</small>\r\n\r\n## 2019\r\n*Drum*, Craft Council Main Gallery, St. John's, NL.\r\n\r\n*In the Shadows*, Art League Houston Main Gallery, Houston, TX.\r\n\r\n## 2017\r\n*Thumb Through*, TRUCK Contemporary Art, Calgary, AB.\r\n\r\n*My-O-My*, CP Projects Space at School of Visual Arts, New York, NY.\r\n<small>curated by Jasa McKenzie</small>\r\n\r\n## 2015\r\n*Citations*, Eastern Edge Gallery, St. John’s, NL.\r\n\r\n*Citations*, Box13 Artspace, Houston, TX.\r\n\r\n## 2014\r\n*Post Performance Syndrome*, Wooster Street Window Gallery [Installation] and Crimson Field, Prince Street Project Space [Installation and Performance], The Leslie-Lohman Museum of Art, New York, NY.\r\n\r\n## 2011\r\n*Openwork*, CAA MFA, Hunter College/Times Square Gallery, New York, NY.\r\n\r\n## 2009\r\n*Hard Candy*, Malaspina Printmakers Gallery, Vancouver, BC.\r\n\r\n## 2008\r\n*The Birds & the Boys*, Plank Gallery, Vancouver, BC.","# Selected Two-Person, Group Exhibitions, and Performances [P]\r\n## 2022\r\n*The Sum of the Parts: Dimensions in Quilting*, Craft Contemporary, Los Angeles, CA.\r\n<small>curated by Holly Jerger</small>\r\n\r\n*Not me, Not that, Not nothing Either*, The Leslie-Lohman Museum of Art, New York, NY.\r\n<small>curated by Nirvana Santos-Kuilan and Rachel Beaudoin</small>\r\n\r\n## 2021 - 2022\r\n*High Touch*, John Michael Kohler Arts Center, Sheboygan, WI.\r\n<small>curated by Kaytie Johnson</small>\r\n\r\n## 2021\r\n*NADA Miami*, Art Fair, Western Exhibitions (Chicago, IL), Miami, FL.\r\n\r\n*Sensorius: Where The Skin Meets The Eye*, Craft Council Main Gallery, St. John’s, NL.\r\n<small>curated by Bruno Vinhas</small>\r\n\r\n*Eight of Pentacles*, RUSCHMAN, Chicago, IL.\r\n\r\n## 2020\r\n*Queer Threads*, Katzen Arts Center at American University, Washington, DC.
