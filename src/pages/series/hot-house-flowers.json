The defense hired an investigator to purchase “obscene” material and argued that the availability of female nude imagery merits that there should be male nude imagery accessible to the public as well. The defendants initially faced 145 years in prison and up to $145,000 in fines each, but later acquitted, as the defense, “[u]sing a customer survey, […] convinced the presiding judge that some of the customers for nude male photographs were women, not just homosexual men.”\r\n\r\nAll images in the magazine are men posed alone without interaction with other people. I am interposing the symbolism of flowers as both women and queers are bonded to this imagery. The former being a sexual threat to the patriarch (“femme fatales”) and the latter as a dissent to heterosexist ethos (“fairies”). As a parallel, flowers were used to signify the sexual perils of both groups, one being that of syphilis (19th century) and the other of AIDS (specifically 1980s-1990s). Both condemned positions. However, the works proposed in this series is a celebration of that longing rather than being castigated for it. Acutely speaking, the connection of feminist and queer ideology is intertwined within these works and suggest a reversal of desire and power.","textThree":"","gridOne":[{"image":"Page22.jpg","subtext":"**Page 22 (Galerie 4)**, 2015\r\nTwo-layer tear and thread on archival inkjet BFK Rives 245 gsm\r\n11\" x 8.5\""},{"image":"Page23.jpg","subtext":"**Page 23 (Galerie 4)**, 2015\r\nTwo-layer tear and thread on archival inkjet BFK Rives 245 gsm\r\n11\" x 8.5\""},{"image":"Page49.jpg","subtext":"**Page 49 (Galerie 4)**, 2015\r\nTwo-layer tear and thread on archival inkjet BFK Rives 245 gsm\r\n11\" x 8.5\""},{"image":"Page33.jpg","subtext":"**Page 33 (Galerie 4)**, 2015\r\nTwo-layer tear and thread on archival inkjet BFK Rives 245 gsm\r\n11\" x 8.5\""}],"gridTwo":[{"image":"Page17.jpg","subtext":"**Page 17 (Galerie 4)**, 2015\r\nWoodcut on poly-organza on stretcher bars; woodcut on singed poly-organza garland\r\n63\" x 72\""},{"image":"Page1Cover.jpg","subtext":"**Page 1 (Cover) (Galerie 4)**, 2015\r\nWoodcut on poly-organza on stretcher bars; woodcut on singed poly-organza\r\n27\" x 18\""},{"image":"Page6.jpg","subtext":"**Page 6 (Galerie 4)**, 2015\r\nWoodcut on poly-organza on stretcher bars; woodcut on singed poly-organza garland\r\n38\" x 24\""},{"image":"Page50.jpg","subtext":"**Page 50 (Galerie 4)**, 2015\r\nWoodcut on poly-organza on stretcher bars; woodcut on singed poly-organza garland\r\n37\" x 24"},{"image":"Page2.jpg","subtext":"**Page 2 (Galerie 4)**, 2015\r\nTwo-layer tear and thread on archival inkjet Rising Stonehenge 245 gsm\r\n6.625” x 5.125”"},{"image":"Page7.jpg","subtext":"**Page 7 (Galerie 4)**, 2015\r\nTwo-layer tear and thread on archival inkjet Rising Stonehenge 245 gsm\r\n6.625” x 5.125”"},{"image":"Page8.jpg","subtext":"**Page 8 (Galerie 4)**, 2015\r\nTwo-layer tear and thread on archival inkjet Rising Stonehenge 245 gsm\r\n6.625” x 5”"},{"image":"Page27.jpg","subtext":"**Page 27 (Galerie 4)**, 2015\r\nTwo-layer tear and thread on archival inkjet Rising Stonehenge 245 gsm\r\n6.625” x 5.125”"},{"image":"Page2.2.jpg","subtext":"**Page 2.2 (Galerie 4)**, 2015\r\nCut out on graphite and archival inkjet (verso) Rising Stonehenge 245 gsm\r\n19” x 19”"},{"image":"Page8.2.jpg","subtext":"**Page 8.2 (Galerie 4)**, 2015\r\nCut out on graphite and archival inkjet (verso) Rising Stonehenge 245 gsm\r\n19” x 19”"},{"image":"Page38.jpg","subtext":"**Page 38 (Galerie 4)**, 2015\r\nCut out on graphite and archival inkjet (verso) Rising Stonehenge 245 gsm\r\n19” x 19”"},{"image":"Page46.2.jpg","subtext":"**Page 46.2 (Galerie 4)**, 2015\r\nCut out on graphite and archival inkjet (verso) Rising Stonehenge 245 gsm\r\n19” x 19”"},{"image":"Page-25-and-26.jpg","subtext":"**Page 25 and 26 (Galerie 4)**, 2015\r\nThree-layer tear and thread on archival inkjet Rising Stonehenge 245 gsm\r\n19.75” x 27.5”\r\n\r\n "},{"image":"Page14.jpg","subtext":"**Page 14 (Galerie 4)**, 2015\r\nTwo-layer tear and thread on archival inkjet Rising Stonehenge 245 gsm\r\n6.625” x 8.75”"},{"image":"Page44.jpg","subtext":"**Page 44 (Galerie 4)**, 2015\r\nTwo-layer tear and thread on archival inkjet Rising Stonehenge 245 gsm\r\n6.625” x 8.875”"},{"image":"Page24.jpg","subtext":"**Page 24 (Galerie 4)**, 2015\r\nTwo-layer tear and thread on archival inkjet Rising Stonehenge 245 gsm\r\n6.625” x 8.75”"},{"image":"Page28.jpg","subtext":"**Page 46 (Galerie 4)**, 2015\r\nThree-layer tear and thread on archival inkjet Rising Stonehenge 245 gsm\r\n6.25” x 6”"},{"image":"Page46.jpg","subtext":"**Page 46 (Galerie 4)**, 2015\r\nThree-layer tear and thread on archival inkjet Rising Stonehenge 245 gsm\r\n6.25” x 6”"},{"image":"Page45.jpg","subtext":"**Page 45 (Galerie 4)**, 2017\r\nThree-layer tear on archival inkjet BFK Rives 245 gsm\r\n9\" x 9\""}]}
