{"name":"Thumb Through","title":"Thumb Through","description":"This series looks at the language of an obscenity case in the 1960s against the expression of love between two men in a soft core magazine.","path":"/series/thumb-through","template":"series","textColor":"#000000","linkColor":"#f79a18","linkHoverColor":"#bf1212","topColor":"#883f5f","bottomColor":"#767fad","textOne":"The prime source for this series is an issue of *My-O-My*, a gay erotic magazine from the late 60s early 70s, which was part of a legal scandal in 1972 in New Jersey (State vs. Shapiro) where police officers, without warrant, entered a bookstore owned by Edward Shapiro and Milton Nerenberg and seized various curiosa that were deemed obscene.\r\n\r\nThere are in total 32 pages that are scanned, printed on 1-yard of fabric, and turned into sculptures. Each sculpture represents a page.\r\n\r\nThis series is a way of tracing and abstracting the imagery of gay male archetypes in erotic and pornographic magazines. The shapes do not refer to anything specific, but are visual intermediaries to a culture that always changes. These are then transformed as queer objects that points you to many direction, rather than bound by gender and sexual preconditions.\r\n","textTwo":"","textThree":"","gridOne":[{"image":"Page15.jpg","subtext":"**Page 15**, 2016\r\nScanned gay erotic page printed with archival ink on cotton, polyurethane foam, vinyl,
