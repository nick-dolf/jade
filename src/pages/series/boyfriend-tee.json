This distance has been arduous for both of us as we venture on new territory with other people, yet still hold on to what we built together. Those dirty shirts you sent me through the mail saved me from going insane in a city that is exciting and ruthless. Your smell allayed the loneliness.\r\n\r\nNow that we’re physically together we seem to be in another journey as we find new directions from an old map. I don’t want to know where it will lead us, but I hope we have fun along the way.\r\n\r\nLove,\r\nJade","textTwo":"","textThree":"","gridOne":[{"image":"12.jpg","subtext":"**#12**, 2016\r\nCut out on boyfriend’s used t-shirt stretched on bars\r\n24\" x 24”"},{"image":"11.jpg","subtext":"**#11**, 2016\r\nCut out on boyfriend’s used t-shirt stretched on bars\r\n24\" x 24”"},{"image":"10.jpg","subtext":"**#10**, 2016\r\nCut out on boyfriend’s used t-shirt stretched on bars\r\n24\" x 24”"},{"image":"9.jpg","subtext":"**#9**, 2016\r\nCut out on boyfriend’s used t-shirt stretched on bars\r\n24\" x 24”"},{"image":"8.jpg","subtext":"**#8**, 2016\r\nCut out on boyfriend’s used t-shirt stretched on bars\r\n24\" x 24”"},{"image":"7.jpg","subtext":"**#7**, 2016\r\nCut out on boyfriend’s used t-shirt stretched on bars\r\n24\" x 24”"},{"image":"6.jpg","subtext":"**#6**, 2016\r\nCut out on boyfriend’s used t-shirt stretched on bars and hydrangea aspera\r\n24\" x 24”"},{"image":"5.jpg","subtext":"**#5**, 2016\r\nCut out on boyfriend’s used t-shirt stretched on bars\r\n24\" x 24”"},{"image":"4.jpg","subtext":"**#4** 2015\r\nCut out on boyfriend’s used t-shirt stretched on bars\r\n24\" x 24”"},{"image":"3.jpg","subtext":"**#3**, 2015\r\nCut out on boyfriend’s used t-shirt stretched on bars\r\n24\" x 24”"},{"image":"2.jpg","subtext":"**#2** , 2015\r\nCut out on boyfriend’s used t-shirt stretched on bars and hydrangea aspera\r\n24\" x 24”"},{"image":"1.jpg","subtext":"**#1** , 2015\r\nBoyfriend’s used t-shirt stretched on bars\r\n24\" x 24”"}],"modalColor":"#796373","page":"series/boyfriend-tee"}
